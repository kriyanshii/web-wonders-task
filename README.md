▶ Your **AIM**: You have to replicate the design as given in the Image file.

▶ Your project will be judged by <br>(1) the amount of implementation you have done <br>(2) the amount of the detailing you have done into design. 

▶ **Your task will be considered valid & will be judged only if you have been able to successfully deploy the project.** 

▶ Instructions for the task:<br>
1.) You have upload your codebase to Github as a public repository. **If the repository is private, your submission will not be considered**<br>
2.) You have to deploy project into the Github account where you have uploaded the codebase. In short deployment & code should be done into the same github account.<br>
3.) It doesn't matter if you have completed the task 100% or not, however incomplete your task is, you should deploy it before the deadline, so that we can judge your submission accordingly.<br>
4.) As decided, you will be having 48 hours of deadline. So you are requested to submit the task before the deadline which is 29th March 23:59 (It means you have whole 28th & 29th to code)<br>
5.) From a group, one and only one member should fill up the form (task submission form) where you have to provide link to your code repository, deployment link, and other information. So please make sure you provide right details at the time of task submission.<br>
6.) Task has to be done into group compulsorily.<br>
7.) Here in this repository you will find all the necessary files that you may need while coding.<br>
